# Challenge18-Tableau

Hi! This is Xenia and here is my Tableau story.

I added the link to the Public Workbook to the repository so I can add the analysis to the readme file here. I also wrote a lot of the analysis in the captions, so be sure to read those insights as well!

Analysis:

I looked at three components of the New York City Bike data. First, I looked at the demographics of the people who used City Bikes. I was surprised to see how many more male members of City Bike used them compared to Females and casual users. Additionally, it was interesting to see that 1/3rd of the bikes used were actually electric!


Next, I looked at when these bike trips were taken. It was interesting to see that members used the bikes more on the weekdays, and less on the weekends. However, the casuals were flipped! They tend to use the bikes on the weekends more, but used them less on the weekdays.  Also, if we look at the different months, the City Bikes were more popular during the Summer months than the Winter months. However, this is because some stations were used to a great amount, while other stations were not that popular, even in the Summer months.


Lastly, I looked at where the bike trips were used overall. I looked at the frequency where Bike trips ended over a map of New York during the years 2021-2022. I found that the Northern part of New York had lots of new locations in the 2022. It was very interesting to see how much the City Bikes expanded, and where they expanded. Besides the Northern part of New York, many locations had similar usage. Some locations were slightly more used in 2021, and others were slightly more used in 2022.

Thank you so much!
